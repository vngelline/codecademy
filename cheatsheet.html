      <h1>CSS Position Property</h1>
      <article>
        <p>The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document. The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine the final location of positioned elements.</p>

The offset does not affect the position of any other elements; thus, the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static.</td>
            <td>This value creates a new stacking context when the value of z-index is not auto. Its effect on table-*-group, table-row, table-column, table-cell, and table-caption elements is undefined.</td>

The element is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (if any) or to the initial containing block. Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.</td>

The element is positioned relative to its initial containing block, which is the viewport in the case of visual media. Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.</td>

The offset does not affect the position of any other elements.</td>
            <td>This value always creates a new stacking context. Note that a sticky element "sticks" to its nearest ancestor that has a "scrolling mechanism" (created when overflow is hidden, scroll, auto, or overlay), even if that ancestor isn't the nearest actually scrolling ancestor.</td>
